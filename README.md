# Array Sort in MIPS Assembly
This repository contains an implementation of an array sorting algorithm in MIPS assembly language, created as part of a school project. The program is a direct translation of a similar sorting algorithm written in C++.

The file that include a thorough description of both programs, testing screenshots, the program written in C++ and its equivalent in assembly language:
